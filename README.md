Hello! My name is Hendrik van Antwerpen.

I use programming language techniques to improve developer and developer tool productivity. Currently I'm doing that as a found engineer @nuanced-dev. Before that I worked in search and code naviation @github, and got a PhD in the field of programming languages at @tudelft-pl.

Fun fact: My avatar is based on a lithographic print by Joan Mir√≥ that hangs over my physical desk!
